# Python-API-Challenge
Module 6 Challenge
Part 1: WeatherPy
In this section, you'll create a Python script to visualise the weather of over 500 cities of varying distances from the equator. You'll use a simple Python libraryLinks to an external site., the OpenWeatherMap APILinks to an external site., and your problem-solving skills to create a representative model of weather across cities.

The first requirement is to create a series of scatter plots to showcase the following relationships:

Temperature (C) vs. Latitude

Humidity (%) vs. Latitude

Cloudiness (%) vs. Latitude

Wind Speed (m/s) vs. Latitude

After each plot, add one to two sentences to explain what the code is analysing.

The second requirement is to compute the linear regression for each relationship. This time, separate the plots into Northern Hemisphere (greater than or equal to 0 degrees latitude) and Southern Hemisphere (less than 0 degrees latitude):

Northern Hemisphere: Temperature (C) vs. Latitude

Southern Hemisphere: Temperature (C) vs. Latitude

Northern Hemisphere: Humidity (%) vs. Latitude

Southern Hemisphere: Humidity (%) vs. Latitude

Northern Hemisphere: Cloudiness (%) vs. Latitude

Southern Hemisphere: Cloudiness (%) vs. Latitude

Northern Hemisphere: Wind Speed (m/s) vs. Latitude

Southern Hemisphere: Wind Speed (m/s) vs. Latitude

After each pair of plots, explain what the linear regression is modelling. Describe any relationships that you notice and any other findings you may uncover.

Your final notebook must meet the following requirements:

Randomly select at least 500 unique (not repeated) cities based on latitude and longitude.

Perform a weather check on each of the cities by using a series of successive API calls.

Include a print log of each city as it's being processed, with the city number and city name.

Save a CSV of all retrieved data and a PNG image for each scatter plot.

Part 2: VacationPy
Now, use your weather data skills to plan future vacations. Use Jupyter gmaps and the Google Places API for this part of the assignment.

NOTE
Remember that any API usage beyond the $200 credit will be charged to your personal account. You can set quotas and limits to your daily requests to be sure that you wonâ€™t be charged. Check out Google Maps Platform BillingLinks to an external site. and Manage your cost of useLinks to an external site. for more information.

Hint: If you are having trouble displaying the maps, run jupyter nbextension enable --py gmaps in your environment and then try again.
To complete this part of the assignment, complete the following steps:

Create a heat map that displays the humidity for every city from Part 1, as in the following image:
heatmap

Narrow down the DataFrame to find your ideal weather condition. For example:
A max temperature lower than 27 degrees but higher than 21

Wind speed less than 4.5 m/s

Zero cloudiness

Drop any rows that don't satisfy all three conditions. You want to be sure that the weather is ideal.
NOTE
Feel free to adjust your specifications, but make sure to set a reasonable limit to the number of rows returned by your API requests.

For each city, use the Google Places API to find the first hotel located within 5,000 metres of your coordinates.

Plot the hotels on top of the humidity heatmap, with each pin containing the Hotel Name, City, and Country, as in the following image:

hotel map

Finally, make sure to meet the following requirements:

You must complete your analysis using a Jupyter notebook.

You must use the Matplotlib or Pandas plotting libraries.

For Part 1, you must include a written description of three observable trends based on the data.

For Part 2, you must take a screenshot of the heatmap that you create and include it in your submission.

Your plots must include labelling aspects like plot title (with date of analysis) and axis labels.

For max intensity in the heatmap, try setting it to the highest humidity found in the dataset.
